# Preact Projects - TypeScript Edition

This repository is a TypeScript adaptation of the "Build 25 React Projects â€“
Tutorial" series by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp), available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdHfJVAY-s).
The original series aims to create 25 React-based projects to help viewers prepare for interviews and
enhance their knowledge of React. While the original videos use React, this
repository provides TypeScript implementations of the projects using Preact, a
lightweight alternative to React with a similar API.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find TypeScript versions of the projects presented
in the freeCodeCamp YouTube series, built with Preact instead of React. Each
project is designed to demonstrate various Preact concepts and techniques,
providing a hands-on learning experience for developers interested in mastering
Preact with TypeScript.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each project,
following the naming convention used in the original series. Each project
directory contains the necessary TypeScript files, along with any additional
resources required for the project.
